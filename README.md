# Apply-filters-to-SQL-queries
<h2>Description</h2>

This project demonstrates proficiency in using SQL to perform precise data extraction from relational databases by applying various filtering techniques. I focused on crafting targeted queries using AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, and IN operators to address real-world business and security investigation scenarios. This showcases my ability to retrieve specific datasets efficiently for analysis and informed decision-making.

<h2>Objective</h2>

The primary goal was to develop and execute SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the employees and log_in_attempts tables based on diverse conditional logic. This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL operators to address complex data retrieval challenges, emphasising both precision and efficiency.

<h2>Key Skills Demonstrated</h2>

* **SQL (Structured Query Language) Proficiency: Writing and executing complex queries.**
* **Advanced Data Filtering: Mastering WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, IN, and != operators.**
* **Relational Database Interaction: Working with structured data across multiple tables.**
* **Pattern Matching: Utilising the LIKE operator with wildcards for flexible data retrieval.**
* **Logical Thinking & Problem-Solving: Translating business/security requirements into effective SQL queries.**
* **Data Analysis for Security Investigations: Identifying anomalies and suspicious patterns.**
* **Data Reporting & Documentation: Clearly articulating query logic and results.**
